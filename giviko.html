<h1 class="hd">Recycle System In Lithuania</h1>
<br>
<h2 class="hd1">Simple and convenient recycling system</h2>
<div class="dv">
    <p>Lithuania has one of the highest recycling rates in Europe. According to data from the European Environment Agency, in 2016 Lithuania has reached its targets for 2030 in packaging waste recycling. In addition, in 2017 the country reported 48% municipal waste recycled and composted (taking eight place in the EU).

        This high rate of municipal recycling is achieved by combining different tactics. Firstly, the government has been greatly focusing on eco-education. Starting from primary school where children are taught how to recycle correctly, up to celebrations and festivals focusing on sustainability. From social commercials on TV to posters in small village stores encouraging people to prevent pollution. These programmes have been successfully running for years, educating people of Lithuania about sustainability.
        
        Secondly, the network of recycling bins is very wide and convenient for citizens. It means that everybody has an easily accessible recycle bin with clear marking and instructions what to put where. Thirdly, the government offers financial incentives to encourage recycling. Residents have to pay taxes for mixed waste disposal. But the disposal of recycled waste is free of charge (because it is paid by companies who release recyclable packaging into the market). Therefore, the more waste residents recycle, the less they have to pay taxes for garbage disposal.</p>

<h2 class="hd2">Waste management in Lithuania</h2>
<p class="p">Correct and responsible waste management is a very important part of environment protection policy of any country. While the “Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.” mantra has been known for a very long time now, the reality is usually less perfect. More and more countries realize the importance of circular economy and try to implement it. However, before circular economy will become standard, other waste management techniques such as recycling, composting and waste burning are widely used. It is important to share best practice examples and learn from each other, in order to avoid pollution resulting from poor waste management. In this posting we will explore how waste is managed in Lithuania.</p>
